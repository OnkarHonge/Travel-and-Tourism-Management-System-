## Abstract
The objective is to manage the details of Customer, Hotel Booking, Cancellation and Tourism places. This application will help in accessing the information related to the travel to the particular destination with great ease. The basic idea behind this project is to save data in a central database which can be accessed by any authorized person to get information and saves time and burden which are being faced by their customers.

## Scope
Creating a web application that is connected to a centralized database. This application will serve only one Tours Agency. The application will assist a user in browsing through a list of tours and/or hotels, to book a tour and/or hotel, to view the food menu if required and to review their order. When users book a hotel for a day, the default check-in and check-out times are 11 am to 11 am next day. Users can only view the food menu; no food coupons or orders available using the current system. Currently the system serves the following eight major Indian cities : Pune, Mumbai, Delhi, Banglore, Hyderabad, Ahemdabad, Chennai, Kolkata.
The desitinations for tours are currently limited to the following cities: Mysore, Sikkim, Jodhpur, Sundarbans, Kanyakumari

## Databse Schema

## Future Scope
The project currently caters to customers from 8 Indian cities only; further expansion to more cities is a potential idea. Currently the food menu can only be viewed and canned be ordered; in future arrangements can be made so as to be able to preorder some food coupons that will allow customers to food buffets at the hotels. Another improment is possible in the booking times section where currently the customer has to book a hotel from 11 am to 11 am; here, more flexibility can be given to the customer, if feasible in the future.
